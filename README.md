Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was a company called DriverPass who was aiming to create a system to help people pass students driving exams on the first attempt. They want to design a system that had levels of users that could access various types of content. The users also are able to schedule in-person training and in-person behind-the-wheel lessons with certified instructors. the admins are able to enable and desable functions like turning off packages that they no longer want to offer or add new packages.The client was a company called DriverPass who was aiming to create resource to help people pass their driving exams on the first attempt.

What did you do particularly well?
i think i did  particularly well on designing the UMLS by recreating the users wants and needs, as well recreating what the student and the admin will have acces to and what not.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
even thought i said i did good on the UMLS i would say that i would re do them again specially the case diagram and its because i forgot to add the teacher and the porpuse of the teacher and add the porpuse 
like i did with the student and the admin.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
the way that i implemented the users need on my system design was by reading the requirement goiing over the interview transcript and making sure i understud everything, after that little by little o broke bits of information to ensure i understood everything. after that i started creating the system and then, what i did next was to ensure that i went over the clients requirements and making sure everything that the client 
wanted was there. i think its very, very important to ensure that we have everything that the client is happy not only that the user has expectation, the user is paying for a product and they expect a good
product.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
my approach is to first go thorought the clients requirements and writing down everything i belive is important.Then, I try to isolate the objects in the system and how they interact. then what i would do next is
create a UML wich is very important because this will help with having a better idea of the design. then i start creating code and then finally start testing to ensure the code is working. i think the strategy that i would use in the future would be using a UML wich i learn on this class and now i see how important it is and helpful.
